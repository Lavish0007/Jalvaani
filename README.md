## Introduction

Welcome to JalVaani – your companion for smarter, sustainable irrigation. [cite: 2] We are a student-led tech team passionate about merging agriculture and innovation. [cite: 4] JalVaani is our step toward empowering farmers with smart tools and weather-based planning to transform traditional irrigation practices. [cite: 5]

## The Problem

Farmers in India face significant challenges related to irrigation:
* **Reliance on Intuition:** Often, watering crops is based on fixed schedules or intuition rather than precise needs. [cite: 6]
* **Water Wastage & Degradation:** Over-irrigation leads to significant water wastage and contributes to soil degradation. [cite: 7]
* **Poor Yield & Crop Loss:** Conversely, under-irrigation results in poor crop yield and substantial crop loss. [cite: 7]
* **Lack of Awareness:** Limited knowledge about local weather patterns negatively impacts effective water planning. [cite: 8]
* **Limited Access:** Many farmers have limited access to government schemes and modern scientific irrigation methods. [cite: 8]
* **Economic Loss:** Excess irrigation wastes money and reduces income. [cite: 13]
* **Environmental Impact:** Waterlogging erodes soil, reduces fertility, and depletes water sources, stressing ecosystems. [cite: 14]
* **Labor & Time:** Manual checks for irrigation consume significant time and can lead to farmer burnout. [cite: 13]

In India, approximately 14% of annual crop loss is attributed to mismanagement, and less than 30% of small farmers are aware of relevant government schemes[cite: 10].

## Our Solution: JalVaani

JalVaani offers an intelligent irrigation planner and weather forecasting tool designed to address these challenges head-on. [cite: 5, 16, 17]

**Key Features (Inferred from impact/screenshots):**
* **Automated Weather-Linked Irrigation Planning:** Provides precise weekly irrigation plans based on real-time and forecasted weather conditions. [cite: 10, 16]
* **Optimized Water Usage:** Aims to reduce water consumption by 25-40% per acre per day. [cite: 10]
* **Improved Crop Yield Consistency:** Seeks to increase yield consistency by 15-25% by preventing over or under-watering. [cite: 10]
* **Predictive Scheduling:** Helps reduce crop loss due to mismanagement through intelligent, predictive scheduling. [cite: 10]
* **Local Notifications for Schemes:** Increases awareness among small farmers about relevant government schemes. [cite: 10]
* **Reduced Disease Risk:** Less overwatering contributes to lower disease incidence. [cite: 15]
* **Reduced Manual Work:** Automation significantly cuts down on manual effort required for irrigation management. [cite: 15]
* **Cost Savings:** Smart scheduling and efficient resource use lead to reduced unnecessary costs. [cite: 15]

## Impact & Analytics

JalVaani predicts significant improvements in key agricultural metrics:

| PARAMETERS                   | CURRENT STATUS             | WITH JALVAANI                      |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Water used per acre          | ~5,000-10,000 L/day        | ↓25-40% savings                    |
| Crop yield variability       | Up to 30% due to poor irrigation | ↑ 15-25% yield consistency         |
| Weather-linked irrigation planning | Rarely done                | Automated                          |
| Crop loss due to mismanagement | ~14% annually in India     | ↓ by predictive scheduling         |
| Awareness of schemes         | <30% of small farmers      | ↑ with local notifications         |

Visual representation of predicted impacts:
* **Water Usage:** Expected to decrease significantly (from 100% to ~60%). [cite: 15]
* **Crop Yield:** Expected to increase substantially (from 100% to ~125%). [cite: 15]
* **Disease Risk:** Expected to decrease (from 100% to ~80%). [cite: 15]
* **Manual Work:** Expected to decrease (from 100% to ~60%). [cite: 15]
* **Cost Saving:** Expected to increase (from 100% to ~125%). [cite: 15]

## Getting Started (Local Development)

To set up and run JalVaani locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Lavish0007/Jalvaani.git](https://github.com/Lavish0007/Jalvaani.git)
    cd Jalvaani
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:** (Assumed based on a typical web project, specific commands would depend on the technology stack, e.g., Python/Django, Node.js/React, etc.)
    ```bash
    # Example for Python/Django:
    # pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    # Example for Node.js:
    # npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment Variables:** (If applicable, for API keys, database connections, etc.)
    * Create a `.env` file based on a `.env.example` (if provided in the repo).
    * Add necessary API keys for weather services, etc.
4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    # Example for Python/Django:
    # python manage.py runserver
    
    # Example for Node.js:
    # npm start
    ```
    The application should then be accessible via your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:8000` or `http://localhost:3000`. Refer to the specific project documentation for exact instructions.
